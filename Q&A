1. How would you deploy this application in production?
In production, the application can be deployed on a server or a cluster of servers managed by a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application should be containerized using Docker and deployed using a container orchestration tool such as Kubernetes to manage the scaling and availability of the application. The AWS SQS Queue and Postgres database can also be hosted in the cloud.

2. What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
To make the application production ready, the following components should be added:

Monitoring and logging: A monitoring tool such as CloudWatch or Logstash can be used to monitor the performance and logs of the application.

Error handling: A comprehensive error handling mechanism should be implemented to handle errors in the application.

Security: Security measures should be implemented to secure the data and access to the application.

Testing: Automated testing should be implemented to ensure that the application is working as expected.

3. How can this application scale with a growing data set?
The application can be scaled by increasing the number of instances of the application running in parallel. This can be achieved using a container orchestration tool such as Kubernetes. The AWS SQS Queue and Postgres database can also be scaled as needed to handle the growing data set.

4. How can PII be recovered later on?
The masked PII data can be recovered by reversing the hash function used to mask the data. This should be done in a secure manner and with proper authorization. A backup of the masked data should also be maintained for recovery purposes.

5. Where and how will your application run?
The application can run on a server or a cluster of servers managed by a cloud provider such as AWS or GCP. The application should be containerized using Docker and deployed using a container orchestration tool such as Kubernetes to manage the scaling and availability of the application. The AWS SQS Queue and Postgres database can also be hosted in the cloud.
